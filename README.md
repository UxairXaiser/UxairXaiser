- About Me
Hello! I'm a passionate software developer and machine learning enthusiast with a keen interest in data science, AI, and open source. I enjoy building projects from scratchâ€”experimenting with algorithms, creating data-driven solutions, and learning new technologies along the way. My GitHub is a collection of my explorations and real-world applications, ranging from simple scripts to advanced models. I'm always eager to collaborate, share insights, and contribute to innovative projects. Let's build something amazing together!
